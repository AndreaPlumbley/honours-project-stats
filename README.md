# honours-project-stats

The R code in this repository is for an Honours Project in Statistics at UCT. 
The project focused on simulating data and using different models to estimate abundance. 
The code should be run in sequential order. 
First the simA package should be installed in R. 
Then the files can be run in order from 2-7. 
File 2 creates the data and the results using functions in simA. 
Files 3-5 plot the results for different models.
File 6 and 7 show plots that were of interest in the project.
